# QAEngine

## Main Idea
A Questions & Answers engine which will provide users the opportunity to
ask questions in any topic they desired.
These questions can be answered by other users which can provide their own opinion/answer to the question.

## Features
- Login system
- Create new account
- Issue new question
- Answer existing questions
- Mark answer as helpful (by the owner of the question)

Nice to have features:
- Create sections for different topics.
- Support file & image uploading.
- Support 2-Factor Authentication.
